        <p>
            Here at Mesa Pizza, we ask ourselves, "What makes great pizza taste so good?" Our answer: freshness.
            <br><br>
            You know how locally sourced food always tastes better than something that's been frozen for a couple of
            days? It's quite simple - contact the nearest farmer for only the freshest of harvests, lay out the
            resulting dough and toppings, bake it all in an oven, and you've got yourself the definition of <i>fresh</i>.
            <br><br>
            Helping local farmers continue to give us great taste. Saving the environment by slashing food shipping. Tons
            of flavors to go around - over 30 varieties! And each and every one of those flavors see piping hot praise every day!
            <br><br>
            So whad'ya waiting for? Stop by the Mesa and see for yourself!
